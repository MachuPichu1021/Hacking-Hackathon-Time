  dialogue:
  - What the... How did I-?
  - Welcome back, sir. I see you around here quite often.
  - What say you and I make a wager? You've seemed down on your luck lately. Why
    don't you go all in on this hand?
  - Your wife is upset at you, no? She thinks your gambling is a problem.
  - How did you know that?
  - She wouldn't feel that way if you came back with a big win.
  - What do you say? Are you willing to take a gamble?
