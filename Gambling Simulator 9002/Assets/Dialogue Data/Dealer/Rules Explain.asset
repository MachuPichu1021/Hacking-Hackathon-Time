  - Blackjack, or 21, is a very simple card game. It's you against me. We want to
    get our card total as close to 21 as possible.
  - Going past 21 is called a bust, and if that happens you automatically lose.
  - You start with 2 cards. If you want to gain an extra card, you can hit. By hitting,
    you get another card to add to your total.
  - However, if you like where you're at, you can stand, in which case it will be
    my turn. I must hit until I get past a soft 17.
  - You may also double, where you put double your bet (provided you have enough)
    and gain only 1 extra card. It is then immediately my turn.
  - 'The cards are worth their numerical value. Jacks, Queens, and Kings are all
    worth 10. Aces are worth 11 or 1. '
  - If you win, you get double your bet back. If our values are tied you keep your
    money.
  - If you get VERY lucky and get a blackjack, or a 21 on the first two cards dealt,
    you get 2.5 times your bet back.
  - Ready to play?
